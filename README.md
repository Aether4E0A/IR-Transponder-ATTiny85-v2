# IR-Transponder-ATTiny85-v2

This is the 2nd version of my open source I-Laps compatible Transponder, using the ATTiny85 and 16MHz resonator.

This uses the DIP-8 package for the ATTiny85. This permits the MCU to be placed in a socket, allowing removal for
reprogramming. A friendly option that can be adapted.
